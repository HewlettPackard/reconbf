    set.  Will fail for, and list, any accounts which are found with no
    password.

    Purpose: Every user account should either have a password set or be
    disabled. One common way for attackers to gain access to a system is to
    enumerate typical user accounts and try to log in with usual credentials,
    or even without credentials.  By ensuring all accounts have passwords or
    are disabled, it makes it harder for an attacker to gain a foothold in the
    system.
