    """
    In following the principle of least privilege, files should be restricted
    to only allow the bare minimum permissions required to allow them to
    function properly.  The ability for untrusted or less trusted users to
    access and/or modify important files can lead to vulnerabilities such as
    information disclosure and privilege escalation.

    Furthermore, the owner and group must be checked for critical files to
    ensure that permissions function as expected.

    More information about a file's usage and why it is important can usually
    be found online or on resources such as Linux man pages.

    Each file is tested against minimum required permissions.  If additional
    permissions are found the test fails and displays the extra permissions
    found.
