    Protection name: Running services

    Check: This checks that groups of services are either running or not
    running.  Which services are checked and how they are checked are
    configurable.

    Purpose: The services that are running make a big difference in the
    security of a system.  Some services add security to a system, such as a
    firewall service, which is used to block unsolicited network connections.
    Some services great detract from the security of a system, such as a
    running telnet server, which can allow users to log in by passing their
    credentials unencrypted.  This provides attackers with a path to gain
    access to the system.
